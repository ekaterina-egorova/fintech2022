Hi I am Katya, founder of Veche, the best crowdsourcing digital platform on the street.

Crowdsourcing literally means getting people outside of your company to work for you. 

Veche gives you the end-to-end product solution when you have huge amount of simple tasks that need to be done by humans, but donâ€™t require special expertise or training - so you want to outsource these tasks to the external crowds.
Such scenarios usually come when you need to improve algorithms in modern technologies such as self-driving vehicles, smart web searches, advanced voice assistants and e-commerce. 
Or your demand could be as simple as that  - your business use clever AI models, and you need 1000 people to teach them to make right decisions.  

With Veche you just define the tasks you need to outsource, and the completion criteria, and Veche will take care of the rest.
Veche find right people to do the tasks, and will ensure it is completed fast, with the best quality, and for the optimal price.
It use advanced techniques such as cross validating of the completion results between users. Which means you are getting the results that you can really trust. 

There are competitors on the market with similar digital platforms, but none of them can boast 15 years of experience in crowdsourcing solutions.
And what really differentiates Veche is its audience of millions of users, who know the platform, and love it for making them extra money.
Trust your crowdsourcing demand to professionals!
