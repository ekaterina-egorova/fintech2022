Hi i am Katya, founder of Veche, the best crowdsourcing digital platform on the street.

Crowdsourcing literally means getting people outside of your company to work for you. 

Veche give you the end-to-end product solution when you have huge amount of simple tasks that need to be done by humans, but donâ€™t require special expertise or training - so you want to outsource to the external crowds.
Such scenarios usually come when you need to improve algorithms in modern technologies such as self-driving vehicles, smart web searches, advanced voice assistants and e-commerce. 
Or lets simply say your business have clever AI models, and you need 1000 people to teach them to make right decisions.  

With Veche you simple define the tasks and the completion criteria. And Veche will take care of it. 
It find right people to do the tasks, and will use efficient algorithms to ensure it is completed fast, with the best quality, and for the optimal price.
There are competitors on the market with similar digital platforms, but none of them can boast 15 years of experience in crowdsourcing.

And what really differentiates Veche is that it has audience of millions of users, who know the platform, and love it for making them extra money.
