Subject: Interview appointment confirmation (November 1, 12:30 PM, Senior Java Developer)


Dear Eugenia, 

Thank you for offering me to apply for the position of Senior Java Depelover for Yandex Market services.
I really appreciate participating in the competition.

The time you proposed, November 1 at 12:30, suits me, I confirm the meeting.
I expect this to be a video meeting and it will take 1.5 hours.

If I understand correctly, this is the first interview in a series of technical interviews,
its format is livecoding and its subject is algorithms. Correct me please if I am wrong.

Sincerely,
Ekaterina Egorova
